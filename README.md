# Retail-Data-Insights
## Business Task
This project involves creating a fictional retail database, extracting and analyzing KPIs using SQL, and visualizing the data in Power BI.
## Database Design
The structure uses four core tables to model fundamental retail workflows.
1. customers
2. orders
3. products
4. order_items

## Extracted KPIs:
- Monthly sales trend (or "Month-over-month sales performance")
- Sales by region (or "Regional sales breakdown")
- Average revenue per user (ARPU) (standard business metric term)
- Best-selling products ranking (or "Top products by sales volume")
